# particle
A cocoonjs canvas+ experiment app.

The Canvas refresh rate on webview or webview+ is rather slow. When I am using requestAnimationFrame(), the update
rate is only about 0.06~0.1S, quite bad, with more than several hundred particles to manage. So I decided to use
Cocoonjs canvas+ to realize the same function. I will test it on my Nexus 4 and another ZTE phone V6S mini.
